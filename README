Put index.html / style.css / overlay.js somewhere accessible.

Periodically run plot-coverage.py. 
This reads:

 * A CSV file with positions. This can be gzipped.
 * A copy of locations.json as generated by the server.

Point the output directory at the same placew as index.html et al.
It will generate data.js and a bunch of PNG images that data.js
refers to.
